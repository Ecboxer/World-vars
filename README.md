# Project Title

Creating and visualising world environmental data with two goals in mind:
Gaining experience with pandas, matplotlib, and other useful python libraries.
Finding relationships in the data and making neat visualisations.

## Getting Started

World_vars.csv is used to build the dataframe for any visualisations in the project
Started with [World_countries_env_vars.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/zanderventer/environmental-variables-for-world-countries/data)
Added sub-region feature from [Country_codes.csv](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv)
Added agricultural land area with [World Bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2) and geographical data found in the CIA's [World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/)
